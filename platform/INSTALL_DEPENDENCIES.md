# Install Required Dependencies

Before using the new gift campaign wizard, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
npm install react-day-picker @radix-ui/react-progress @radix-ui/react-radio-group
```

These packages are required for:
- **react-day-picker**: Calendar component for scheduling campaigns
- **@radix-ui/react-progress**: Progress bar for wizard steps
- **@radix-ui/react-radio-group**: Radio group component for selections

After installing, the campaign wizard will be fully functional.
